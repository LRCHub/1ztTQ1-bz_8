Who is this Baba Yaga...
Boogeyman, Terminator
Bitch, I'm the exterminator
Better suit up, go ahead call your tailor...
Only kill for the money
You ain't got a code, Boogeyman's got to go
Family killed for a paycheck so...
I'm killing anybody who can make that whole
Nothing like you, boohoo your wife died
You ever seen the life leave your child's eyes?
Two times, what a fine line to ride by
But I'll never kill anyone to ride high
Nothing but a thug, and I kill those, drill holes,
In ya dome with a .44 and some pillows
I ain't Vigo I don't rock a tuxedo
Skull on the chest, every method is lethal

Baba Yaga and Punisher
They will come for you
And when they coming
There's really nothing
That you can do
Realist killers
They pulling triggers
And thinning crews
Now they battling
Instead of killing you...
Baba Yaga and Punisher
They will come for you
And they coming
There's really nothing
That you can do
Realist killers
They pulling triggers
And thinning crews
Now they battling
Instead of killing you...

Really, you're judging me?
You think that you'll punish me?
Really, you're funny, P
Seeking revenge for those who were loving me
Isn't that what you were fighting for?
They have took everything that I adore
I am respecting your cause but...
If you come at me, then we are at odds
Murder at will, so easy to do so...
Barely could handle a battle with Russo
How you expecting to tussle with me
That yelling and screaming
Means nothing to me
I am the Punisher's reckoning
Sentencing Castle to death
Not bluffing a threat
Keep it up and there'll be agony soon
Adding your name to the family tomb

Baba Yaga and Punisher
They will come for you
And when they coming
There's really nothing
That you can do
Realist killers
They pulling triggers
And thinning crews
Now they battling
Instead of killing you...
Baba Yaga and Punisher
They will come for you
And they coming
There's really nothing
That you can do
Realist killers
They pulling triggers
And thinning crews
Now they battling
Instead of killing you...

We aren't the same, my story is rawness
Family murdered, not natural causes
All this for nothing, you wrestle with death
To settle the debt of a meddling pet
That meddling pet was all that I had
The closest that I'll ever come to a dad
Is it hard living now knowing inside
You're family is dead cause you are alive
