Dark to light
The future never so bright
Prophecy spoken in tongues
The bell that can't be unrung
Fanatic Fantasy

They've got good news
It's so sick living in a fanfic
They've got good news
There's new life springing from a death cult

Tearing up, you scream
In endless fever dreams
Unmoored, you'll cling
To almost anything

Light to dark
They're tryna breakin' the arc
But now the covenants broke
And now they're dying for a joke
After living a lie

They'vе got good news
It's so sick living in a fanfic
They've got good nеws
There's new life springing from a death cult

Tearing up, you scream
In endless fever dreams
White-knuckle, you'll cling
To almost anything
Your family, they tried
To pull you out alive

Oh, pity, pity, pity, pity
Storm came and went
And now your life is spent

Sun sets before my eyes
We're walking backwards into the night
What did we do before light?

Looking fondly to the past
Through warped reflections in the plexiglass, well
They thought they had it all right

When you decide to take a stand
Capped in the neck by a mall cop's hands
The future never looked so bright

A whole new dark age!
It's burning bright with a hot white rage!
What did we do before light?

Haha
